Also known as the Veerabhadra Temple, this ancient Vijaynagara-styled compound articulates the exotic stone carvings and profuses every bit of what India was famous for. The fresco paintings of Rama and Krishna, the central monument with tales from Purana and the mount of Lord Shiva from a single rock (supposedly the largest in the world), this 16th-century temple cultivates every bit of your curiosity. What's astounding is the fact that it is also known as the Hanging Temple of India for the fact that all the 70 marvellous stone pillars that support the Veerabhadra Varbhagriha are not touching the ground. The reason for this remains a mystery!
