Whoever plans a visit to the panorama of the Himalayas and enjoying the snow of Manali, Hidimba Temple gets automatically named on the bucket-list. The wooden architecureed-temple in the midst of forests and snow is quite a religious hotspot and one of the iconic destinations in Himachal Pradesh. However, it's known as the Temple with No Idol and there is no idol being worshipped here. There is a supposed footprint of Rakshashi Hidimba which is revered in this temple. Legend goes that after Bhima killed the brother of Hidimba and their son, Ghatotkacha went away, she spent her time meditating in the forest and ensuring the welfare of the folks of the valley. Since she never resided in the forest, a stone bearing her footprint is worshipped here since ages.
